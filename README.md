# Image-Classifier-
Multi-class classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
<br><br>
**Dataset** <br>
It contains images of different sizes of 3 classes, viz. Butterfly, Leopard and Piano. The dataset is a subset of Cifar-10 dataset.
<br>
<br>
**Problem Statement** <br>
To classify the images into their corresponding classes.
<br> <br>
***Visualization-Filters and Convolution outputs*** ->
The code intializes the filters using Kaiming initialization, perfroms convolution and visualizes them, all from scratch using Python. <br>
***Image_Classifier.ipynb*** ->
The code for performing image classification using convolutional neural network.
